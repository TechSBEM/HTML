<h1>Best Movies Of All Time According To Emmanuel</h1>
<h2>My Best Three(3)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. VINLAND SAGA</h3>
<p>A well developed story that drops all pretenses of a typical anime
     and goes out of its way to build realistic and understandable 
     characters that fit perfectly in the time period that they exist in.</p>

<h3>2. AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER (2022)</h3>
<p>Critics Consensus: Narratively, it might be fairly standard stuff -- but visually speaking, Avatar: 
    The Way of Water is a stunningly immersive experience.</p>

<h3>3. JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 (2023)</h3>
<p>ohn Wick: Chapter 4 piles on more of everything -- and suggests that when it comes to a well-dressed
     Keanu Reeves dispatching his enemies in lethally balletic style, there can never be too much</p>
